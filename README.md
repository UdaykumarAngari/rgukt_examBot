# RGUKT Exam Notice Bot

The project aims to ensure that no student misses critical academic announcements due to unreliable or informal communication channels.

## Why This Project?

### Problem

At RGUKT, important academic notifications—such as **remedial exam registration announcements**—are often circulated through informal channels like WhatsApp groups or forwarded messages. Due to message overload, delayed forwarding, or limited reach of these groups, several students missed critical notifications from the RGUKT Hub, resulting in missed deadlines and academic inconvenience.

---

### Solution

To address this issue, a **dedicated Telegram notification bot** was developed. The bot independently tracks official RGUKT exam and academic notice sources and publishes verified updates directly to a centralized Telegram channel. This removes dependency on informal forwarding mechanisms and ensures timely, consistent, and reliable delivery of important announcements.

---

### Impact

The application provides a **centralized and reliable notification system** for RGUKT students. By delivering real-time updates via Telegram, it significantly reduces the risk of missing time-sensitive academic information, improves communication efficiency, and enhances students’ ability to stay informed without repeatedly checking multiple platforms.
